## 🌟 What is ReadWithMe?

ReadWithMe is an AI-powered learning platform that gamifies how students read books to improve their reading comprehension. Through various gaming activities, engaging challenges, personalized feedback, and adaptive difficulty levels, ReadWithMe transforms the reading experience into an interactive and motivating learning process! 🎮📖

Our platform uses advanced natural language processing to generate relevant questions about the books students are reading. These questions range from basic comprehension checks to more complex analytical inquiries, encouraging students to think critically about the text they're studying. 🤔💡

## 🎯 What is it for?

ReadWithMe aims to address the literacy challenges faced by young learners, particularly in the Philippines. By using gamification and adaptive learning technologies, we make reading comprehension more engaging and accessible, ultimately helping students improve their skills in an enjoyable way. 🇵🇭📈

We're solving the problems of:
- Low literacy rates 📉
- Lack of interest in reading 😴
- Limited access to educational tools 🚫

By providing a scalable, interactive, and user-friendly platform! 🚀

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
- NPM/Yarn 📦
- Docker Desktop 🐳
- Juno CLI 🛰️

### How to run?

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Install Juno CLI: `npm i -g @junobuild/cli`
3. Open Docker Desktop (if not installed, download from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)) 
   *For Macs, a lightweight alternative is [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/)*
4. Create and run the Docker container for the website: `juno dev start`
5. In another terminal, run the website for testing: `npm run dev`
6. To allow sharing the website on LAN: `npm run dev -- --host`
7. *Note: At first visit, there's a security warning because it uses HTTPS without a certificate. You can safely ignore it as it's only used to make the camera functionality work in LAN, especially on mobile.*

### 🌐 How to deploy to the mainnet?

1. Create a satellite in the [Juno console](https://console.juno.build/)
2. Open a terminal and login to the Juno CLI: `juno login`
3. On the root of your project, open a terminal and build your project for deployment: `npm run build`
4. Once your website is built (check for **dist** or **build** folder), then deploy your website to Juno: `juno deploy`
5. To open your website, run: `juno open` (You can also go to the Juno console to view the canister URL)
